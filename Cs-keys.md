<h2>Internet</h2>
The internet is defined as a global network of linked computers, servers, phones, and smart appliances that communicate with each other using the transmission control protocol (TCP) standard to enable the fast exchange of information and files, along with other types of services
<h2>7 layers of OSI model</h2>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08a4d20a-3ad2-4080-8560-8d024cf9d641"><br/>
1.The Physical Layer:-The physical layer is where the raw bitstream is physically transmitted over a physical medium. 
2.The Data Link Layer:-The data link layer breaks data to be transmitted into frames for transmission at the physical layer.
3.The Network Layer:-At the network layer, the focus expands from a point-to-point link to include many interconnected nodes within a network.
4.The Transport Layer:-This layer manages the transmission of data between nodes, including ensuring that data arrives in the correct sequence and that any errors are corrected.
5.The Session Layer:-The session layer manages sessions between nodes and acts on the “data” PDU. Session management includes setup, authentication, termination, and reconnections.
6.The Presentation Layer:-The presentation layer is primarily responsible for translating data from network data to the formats expected by an application. For example, data encodings and encryption are managed at Layer 6.
7.The Application Layer:-The application layer includes protocols designed for end-users. For example, HTTP is a Layer 7 protocol designed to transmit data between a web server and a client.

<h1>VPN</h1>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/283cb596-6cfe-4225-817f-bc6a9b5f47d2">
A VPN, which stands for virtual private network, establishes a digital connection between your computer and a remote server owned by a VPN provider, creating a point-to-point tunnel that encrypts your personal data, masks your IP address, and lets you sidestep website blocks and firewalls on the internet.
<h1>BLOCKCHAIN</h1>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/513b84cc-83e7-4f75-9f62-80e13e43e49a">
Blockchain is a distributed database or ledger shared among a computer network's nodes. They are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions, but they are not limited to cryptocurrency uses.
<h3><b>FPGA (Field Programming Gate Arrays)</b></h3><br>
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cdf83c6-b16d-4780-a08f-70c94394e7b6" height="150",width="70"><br>
A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is a type of configurable integrated circuit that can be repeatedly programmed after manufacturing. FPGAs are a subset of logic devices referred to as programmable logic devices (PLDs). They consist of an array of programmable logic blocks with a connecting grid, that can be configured "in the field" to interconnect with other logic blocks to perform various digital functions.
<h2><b>Server</b></h2>
A server is a computer that provides information to other computers called "clients" on computer network.[1] This architecture is called the client–server model. Servers can provide various functionalities, often called "services", such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients or performing computations for a client. A single server can serve multiple clients, and a single client can use multiple servers. A client process may run on the same device or may connect over a network to a server on a different device.

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and distributed name service that provides a naming system for computers, services, and other resources on the Internet or other Internet Protocol (IP) networks. It associates various information with domain names (identification strings) assigned to each of the associated entities. Most prominently, it translates readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols.

An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label such as 192.0.2.1 that is assigned to a device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. IP addresses serve two main functions: network interface identification, and location addressing.
<h1><b>Assembler</b></h1>
