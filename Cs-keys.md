<body>The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the primary component of a computer that acts as its “control center.” The CPU, also referred to as the “central” or “main” processor, is a complex set of electronic circuitry that runs the machine's operating system and apps</body>
<h1><b>GPU</b></h1>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e2ee8fa-6334-4675-af18-13ee8a5910ea">
<body>Graphics processing unit, a specialized processor originally designed to accelerate graphics rendering. GPUs can process many pieces of data simultaneously, making them useful for machine learning, video editing, and gaming applications.Example - nvidia </body>
<h1><b>NETWORK</b></h1>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b69d568a-db0e-4295-b2aa-ae097fb6cee2">
A network is basically a collection of computers and other devices that are linked together to exchange data
<h2>Internet</h2>
The internet is defined as a global network of linked computers, servers, phones, and smart appliances that communicate with each other using the transmission control protocol (TCP) standard to enable the fast exchange of information and files, along with other types of services
<h2>7 layers of OSI model</h2>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08a4d20a-3ad2-4080-8560-8d024cf9d641"><br/>
1.The Physical Layer:-The physical layer is where the raw bitstream is physically transmitted over a physical medium. 
2.The Data Link Layer:-The data link layer breaks data to be transmitted into frames for transmission at the physical layer.
3.The Network Layer:-At the network layer, the focus expands from a point-to-point link to include many interconnected nodes within a network.
4.The Transport Layer:-This layer manages the transmission of data between nodes, including ensuring that data arrives in the correct sequence and that any errors are corrected.
5.The Session Layer:-The session layer manages sessions between nodes and acts on the “data” PDU. Session management includes setup, authentication, termination, and reconnections.
6.The Presentation Layer:-The presentation layer is primarily responsible for translating data from network data to the formats expected by an application. For example, data encodings and encryption are managed at Layer 6.
7.The Application Layer:-The application layer includes protocols designed for end-users. For example, HTTP is a Layer 7 protocol designed to transmit data between a web server and a client.


<h1>ASIC</h1>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95c2185c-dd0f-4355-848b-5354fd933b96">
An application-specific integrated circuit is an integrated circuit (IC) that’s custom-designed for a particular task or application. 
<h1>CISC</h1>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1193c4cc-0439-4a5f-92c2-93d4b1e33dd8"><br/>
Complex instruction set computing (CISC), often referred to as “CISC,” stands as a fundamental element in the evolution of complex computer processors, reflecting a distinct design philosophy that diverges from the Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) approach. 
<h1>RISC</h1>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2254d5a6-4013-4f8f-8290-8bebdd856dd3"><br/>
A Reduced Instruction Set Computer is a type of microprocessor architecture that utilizes a small, highly-optimized set of instructions rather than the highly-specialized set of instructions typically found in other architectures.
<h2>RISC-V</h2>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02f246b1-6d0e-44a6-a12c-602c17dfd95b"><br/>
RISC-V” stands for Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) and the “V” represents the fifth version of the RISC architecture. Unlike proprietary architectures such as ARM and x86, RISC-V is an open standard, allowing anyone to implement it without the need for licensing fees.
<h1>VPN</h1>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/283cb596-6cfe-4225-817f-bc6a9b5f47d2">
A VPN, which stands for virtual private network, establishes a digital connection between your computer and a remote server owned by a VPN provider, creating a point-to-point tunnel that encrypts your personal data, masks your IP address, and lets you sidestep website blocks and firewalls on the internet.
<h1>BLOCKCHAIN</h1>
blockchain is a distributed database or ledger shared among a computer network's nodes. They are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions, but they are not limited to cryptocurrency uses.
